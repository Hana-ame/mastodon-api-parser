(DEPRECATED) Upload media as an attachment
POST /api/v1/media HTTP/1.1
Creates an attachment to be used with a new status. This method will return after the full sized media is done processing.

Returns: MediaAttachment
OAuth: User token + write:media
Version history:
0.0.0 - added
2.3.0 - add focus parameter
3.1.3 - deprecated in favor of POST /api/v2/media, which is equal to v1 in all aspects, except it returns HTTP 202, and the returned JSON object has a url of null. This is because while the thumbnail is prepared synchronously, the full version of the media attachment will be processed in the background.
3.2.0 - add thumbnail parameter
